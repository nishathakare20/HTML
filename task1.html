            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many
                different versions of HTML.
                The most widely used version throughout the 2000s was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in
                December 1999.
                Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that
                is used to create other markup languages.
                Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML,
                and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language
                (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful,
                and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML
                became an official standard in 2000 and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML but has
                stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages because, without them, interoperability
                between applications would be impossible.
                You'll learn more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2.

            <h2>HTML Element</h2>
            <p>An HTML element is a fundamental building block of an HTML document, defining the structure and content
                of a webpage. It typically consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.
                Elements provide the structure, formatting, and semantic meaning to web content.

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses
                everything from designing the user interface to coding the functionality and managing the underlying
                infrastructure.
                Essentially, it's the practice of creating digital experiences that are accessible via the internet.
